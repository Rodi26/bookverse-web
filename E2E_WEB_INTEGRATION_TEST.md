# Adaptive Web Service Integration Test

This file validates the adaptive web service onboarding and shared infrastructure integration.

## Integration Points Tested:
- ✅ Shared analyze-commit script from bookverse-devops
- ✅ Shared OIDC exchange script (eliminates ~65 lines of duplicate logic)
- ✅ Shared semver determination script
- ✅ Frontend-specific adaptations preserved
- ✅ Node.js/Vite build process maintained

## Adaptive Approach:
The web service integration demonstrates how to adapt shared infrastructure
for different technology stacks while preserving service-specific patterns.
