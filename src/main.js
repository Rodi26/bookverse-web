/**
 * BookVerse Web Application - Main Application Bootstrap
 *
 * This module serves as the primary entry point for the BookVerse Web Application,
 * implementing application initialization, routing setup, and global service
 * registration for the modern single-page e-commerce frontend.
 *
 * üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview:
 *     - Application Bootstrap: Complete SPA initialization and configuration
 *     - Client-Side Routing: Hash-based routing for seamless navigation
 *     - Service Integration: Global registration of API services and utilities
 *     - Demo Mode Operation: Simplified authentication for demonstration environments
 *     - Progressive Enhancement: Graceful degradation and accessibility support
 *
 * üöÄ Key Features:
 *     - Single-Page Application (SPA) architecture with client-side routing
 *     - Modular component system with lazy loading capabilities
 *     - Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
 *     - Global service registration for cross-component access
 *     - Release information integration for version tracking
 *     - Demo-optimized user experience without authentication complexity
 *
 * üîß Technical Implementation:
 *     - Hash-based routing for compatibility and simplicity
 *     - ES6 modules with tree-shaking optimization
 *     - Async/await patterns for better error handling
 *     - Global API exposure for debugging and development
 *     - Component lifecycle management and cleanup
 *
 * üìä Business Logic:
 *     - E-commerce user journey from catalog to checkout
 *     - Product discovery and recommendation integration
 *     - Shopping cart persistence and state management
 *     - User experience optimization for conversion
 *     - Demo showcase with representative user workflows
 *
 * üõ†Ô∏è Usage Patterns:
 *     - Single entry point for all application functionality
 *     - Route configuration and component registration
 *     - Global service access and debugging utilities
 *     - Development mode enhancements and tooling
 *     - Production deployment with optimized bundles

/**
 * Bootstrap the BookVerse Web Application with complete initialization.
 * 
 * This function serves as the primary application initialization routine,
 * setting up routing, services, and global application state for the
 * BookVerse e-commerce frontend. It implements a robust initialization
 * sequence with error handling and graceful degradation.
 * 
 * üéØ Purpose:
 *     - Initialize single-page application architecture
 *     - Configure client-side routing and navigation
 *     - Register global services and utilities for cross-component access
 *     - Set up release information tracking and version display
 *     - Enable demo mode with simplified authentication
 * 
 * üîß Implementation Details:
 *     - Validates DOM structure and application container
 *     - Configures hash-based routing for SEO and compatibility
 *     - Registers route handlers for all application views
 *     - Sets up global service access for debugging and development
 *     - Initializes release information display and tracking
 * 
 * üöÄ Initialization Sequence:
 *     1. DOM validation and container verification
 *     2. Demo mode configuration and authentication bypass
 *     3. Router initialization with route-to-component mapping
 *     4. Default route navigation and deep linking support
 *     5. Release information initialization and version tracking
 *     6. Global service registration for development and debugging
 * 
 * @async
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Promise resolving when application is fully initialized
 * 
 * @throws {Error} Application container not found or initialization failure
 * 
 * @example
 * // Application automatically bootstraps on page load
 * // No manual invocation required
 * 
 * @example
 * // Access global services after bootstrap (development/debugging)
 * const books = await window.listBooks(1, 20);
 * const response = await window.httpJson('inventory', '/api/books');
 * window.navigateTo('/book/123');
 * 
 * @since 1.0.0

  // üß≠ Router Initialization: Configure client-side routing with component mapping

    '/home': renderHome,          // Home page: Welcome and featured content

    '/book/:id': renderBook,      // Product Detail: Individual book information
    '/cart': renderCart           // Shopping Cart: Review and checkout workflow
  })

  // üöÄ Default Navigation: Navigate to catalog if no route specified
  if (!location.hash) {
    navigateTo('/')

  // üìã Release Information: Initialize version tracking and display
  initReleaseInfo()

  // üîß Global Service Registration: Expose services for debugging and development
  window.httpRequest = httpRequest    // Low-level HTTP client for API requests
  window.httpJson = httpJson          // JSON HTTP client with response parsing
  window.listBooks = listBooks        // Inventory service for book catalog
  window.getBook = getBook            // Inventory service for individual books
  window.navigateTo = navigateTo      // Router navigation for programmatic routing

  // ‚úÖ Initialization Complete: Application ready for user interaction
  console.log('‚úÖ BOOTSTRAP: BookVerse application initialized successfully')

// üöÄ Application Entry Point: Start application initialization
