/**
 * BookVerse Web Application - Debounce Utility
 *
 * This module provides performance optimization utilities for the BookVerse platform,
 * implementing debouncing patterns to control function execution frequency, reduce
 * unnecessary API calls, and enhance user experience through optimized event handling
 * and resource management.
 *
 * 🏗️ Architecture Overview:
 *     - Function Scheduling: Timer-based function execution control
 *     - Performance Optimization: Reduces unnecessary function calls and API requests
 *     - Event Handling: Optimizes user input processing and search operations
 *     - Memory Management: Efficient timer management with automatic cleanup
 *     - User Experience: Smooth interaction patterns without excessive processing
 *
 * 🚀 Key Features:
 *     - Configurable delay timing for different use cases and performance requirements
 *     - Automatic timer cleanup preventing memory leaks and resource waste
 *     - Context preservation maintaining proper 'this' binding for method calls
 *     - Argument forwarding preserving complete function signatures and parameters
 *     - Immediate cancellation enabling responsive user interaction patterns
 *
 * 🔧 Technical Implementation:
 *     - Timer Management: setTimeout-based execution scheduling with cleanup
 *     - Closure Pattern: Encapsulated state management for timer tracking
 *     - Function Application: Proper context and argument preservation
 *     - Memory Efficiency: Automatic cleanup preventing timer accumulation
 *     - Performance Optimization: Minimal overhead with maximum efficiency
 *
 * 📊 Business Logic:
 *     - Cost Optimization: Reduces API calls and server load through intelligent batching
 *     - User Experience: Prevents UI lag and excessive processing during rapid input
 *     - Performance Gains: Optimizes search, autocomplete, and real-time features
 *     - Resource Conservation: Minimizes network traffic and computational overhead
 *     - Responsiveness: Maintains smooth user interactions without sacrifice
 *
 * 🛠️ Usage Patterns:
 *     - Search input optimization for real-time search and autocomplete
 *     - API call throttling for performance and cost optimization
 *     - Event handler optimization for scroll, resize, and input events
 *     - Form validation timing for user-friendly feedback
 *     - Auto-save functionality with intelligent timing

/**
 * Create debounced function that delays execution until after a specified wait period.
 * 
 * This function implements the debouncing pattern to control function execution frequency
 * by delaying execution until a specified time has passed without additional calls.
 * It's essential for optimizing performance in scenarios with rapid, repeated function calls.
 * 
 * 🎯 Purpose:
 *     - Control function execution frequency for performance optimization
 *     - Reduce unnecessary API calls and computational overhead
 *     - Optimize user input handling and search operations
 *     - Prevent UI lag during rapid user interactions
 *     - Enable intelligent batching of expensive operations
 * 
 * 🔧 Implementation Features:
 *     - Timer-based execution delay with automatic cleanup
 *     - Complete argument preservation and forwarding
 *     - Proper context (this) binding for method calls
 *     - Immediate cancellation of pending executions
 *     - Memory-efficient timer management
 * 
 * @param {Function} fn - Function to debounce and control execution timing
 * @param {number} [waitMs=300] - Delay in milliseconds before function execution
 * @returns {Function} Debounced function with controlled execution timing
 * 
 * @example
 * // Search input optimization
 * const searchBooks = debounce(async (query) => {
 *   const results = await searchAPI(query);
 *   updateSearchResults(results);
 * }, 500);
 * 
 * // Attach to input event
 * searchInput.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
 *   searchBooks(e.target.value);
 * });
 * 
 * @example
 * // API call optimization for auto-save
 * const autoSave = debounce((formData) => {
 *   saveToServer(formData);
 * }, 2000);
 * 
 * // Auto-save on form changes
 * formElements.forEach(element => {
 *   element.addEventListener('change', () => {
 *     autoSave(getFormData());
 *   });
 * });
 * 
 * @example
 * // Window resize optimization
 * const handleResize = debounce(() => {
 *   recalculateLayout();
 *   updateComponentSizes();
 * }, 250);
 * 
 * window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
 * 
 * @example
 * // Method debouncing with context preservation
 * class SearchComponent {
 *   constructor() {
 *     this.search = debounce(this.performSearch.bind(this), 400);
 *   }
 * 
 *   performSearch(query) {
 *     // 'this' context properly preserved
 *     this.results = this.searchService.search(query);
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * Performance Benefits:
 *     - Reduces API calls: Multiple rapid calls become single delayed call
 *     - Improves responsiveness: Prevents UI blocking during rapid events
 *     - Saves bandwidth: Minimizes network requests through intelligent batching
 *     - Reduces server load: Fewer requests to backend services
 * 
 * Common Use Cases:
 *     - Search autocomplete: Delay search until user stops typing
 *     - Form validation: Validate after user finishes input
 *     - Auto-save: Save changes after user activity pauses
 *     - Scroll/resize events: Optimize expensive layout calculations
 *     - API throttling: Control request frequency to external services
