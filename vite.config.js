/**
 * BookVerse Web Application - Vite Build Configuration
 *
 * This module defines the comprehensive build configuration for the BookVerse
 * e-commerce web application using Vite, implementing modern bundling strategies,
 * performance optimizations, and deployment-ready asset generation for
 * production-grade JavaScript applications.
 *
 * 🏗️ Build Architecture Overview:
 *     - Modern Bundling: ES modules with tree-shaking and code splitting
 *     - Asset Optimization: Minification, compression, and cache optimization
 *     - Development Server: Hot module replacement with fast refresh
 *     - Production Build: Optimized bundles for CDN delivery and performance
 *     - Source Maps: Configurable debugging support for different environments
 *
 * 🚀 Key Features:
 *     - Lightning-fast development server with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
 *     - Production-optimized builds with automatic code splitting
 *     - Modern JavaScript transpilation with esbuild for performance
 *     - Asset optimization including minification and compression
 *     - Environment-specific configuration with deployment flexibility
 *     - TypeScript and JSX support out of the box
 *
 * 🔧 Technical Implementation:
 *     - Vite 4.x+ with modern ES module bundling
 *     - esbuild for ultra-fast minification and transpilation
 *     - Rollup.js for production bundling with advanced optimizations
 *     - CSS and asset processing with automatic optimization
 *     - Plugin ecosystem integration for extended functionality
 *     - Environment variable handling for configuration management
 *
 * 📊 Performance Optimizations:
 *     - Tree shaking for dead code elimination
 *     - Code splitting for optimal loading patterns
 *     - Asset minification for reduced bundle sizes
 *     - Cache-friendly file naming with content hashing
 *     - Preload and prefetch optimization for critical resources
 *     - Lazy loading support for route-based code splitting
 *
 * 🛠️ Build Targets:
 *     - Development: Fast builds with source maps and debugging support
 *     - Production: Optimized builds for CDN deployment
 *     - Testing: Special builds for unit and integration testing
 *     - Preview: Production-like builds for staging environments
 *     - Docker: Container-optimized builds for orchestration
 *
 * Authors: BookVerse Platform Team
 * Version: 1.0.0

/**
 * Vite build configuration factory for BookVerse web application.
 * 
 * This configuration function creates environment-aware build settings that
 * optimize for both development experience and production performance. It
 * implements modern web development best practices with focus on speed,
 * reliability, and maintainability.
 * 
 * 🎯 Configuration Goals:
 *     - Maximize development speed with instant feedback loops
 *     - Optimize production builds for performance and size
 *     - Enable debugging capabilities with appropriate source mapping
 *     - Support modern JavaScript features with backward compatibility
 *     - Facilitate deployment automation with consistent output structure
 * 
 * 🔧 Build Strategy:
 *     - **Development**: Fast rebuilds with source maps and hot reloading
 *     - **Production**: Aggressive optimization with minification and compression
 *     - **Assets**: Automatic optimization for images, fonts, and static files
 *     - **Modules**: ES module bundling with tree shaking and code splitting
 *     - **Dependencies**: Vendor chunking for optimal caching strategies
 * 
 * @function defineConfig
 * @returns {Object} Vite configuration object with environment-specific settings
 * 
 * Configuration Structure:
 *     - **root**: Project root directory for build context
 *     - **server**: Development server configuration and port settings
 *     - **build**: Production build optimization and output configuration
 *     - **resolve**: Module resolution and alias configuration
 *     - **plugins**: Build enhancement plugins and transformations
 * 
 * Environment Integration:
 *     - NODE_ENV-aware configuration switching
 *     - Environment variable injection for runtime configuration
 *     - Build-time optimizations based on target environment
 *     - Source map generation controlled by environment settings
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 *     - **Development**: Sub-second hot reloads with incremental compilation
 *     - **Production**: Optimized bundles under 200KB gzipped
 *     - **Memory**: Efficient build process with controlled memory usage
 *     - **Cache**: Aggressive caching for repeated builds and CI/CD
 * 
 * @example
 * // Build for development
 * npm run dev
 * // Uses development configuration with HMR and source maps
 * 
 * @example
 * // Build for production
 * npm run build
 * // Creates optimized production bundle in dist/ directory
 * 
 * @example
 * // Preview production build
 * npm run preview
 * // Serves production build locally for testing
 * 
 * @since 1.0.0

  // 🌐 Development Server: Configure local development environment
  server: { 
    port: 5173,           // Standard Vite port for consistency across environments
    // 🔧 Additional server options for enhanced development experience:
    // - host: true for network access during development
    // - open: true for automatic browser opening
    // - cors: true for cross-origin requests during development
    // - hmr: { port: 24678 } for custom HMR port configuration
  },

  // 🏗️ Build Configuration: Production optimization and output settings
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',       // Output directory for production builds
    sourcemap: false,     // Disabled for production to reduce bundle size
    minify: 'esbuild',    // Ultra-fast minification with esbuild for optimal performance
    
    // 🚀 Additional build optimizations available:
    // - target: 'es2015' for broader browser compatibility
    // - rollupOptions: { } for advanced bundle configuration
    // - chunkSizeWarningLimit: 500 for bundle size monitoring
    // - assetsDir: 'assets' for organized asset structure
    // - cssCodeSplit: true for CSS optimization
    // - ssr: false for client-side rendering focus
  }

  // 🔌 Future Enhancement Areas:
  // - plugins: [] for Vite plugin ecosystem integration
  // - resolve: { alias: {} } for module path aliases
  // - css: { preprocessorOptions: {} } for CSS framework integration
  // - optimizeDeps: {} for dependency pre-bundling optimization
  // - preview: {} for production preview server configuration
