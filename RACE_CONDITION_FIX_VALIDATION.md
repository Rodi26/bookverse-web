# Race-Condition Fix Validation

This commit validates the race-condition-safe semver logic implemented in bookverse-infra.

## Key Improvements:
- Unique version generation using commit SHA + run number
- Prevents 409 conflicts in concurrent CI runs
- Maintains semantic versioning principles

## Expected Result:
- ✅ No more 409 'version already exists' errors
- ✅ Each workflow run gets unique version number
- ✅ Complete 0-issue workflow execution including PROD promotion
